# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains a jupyter notebook with code required to create models to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The data used for this project is from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a model that accurately predicts who survives. The accuracy is the percentage of passengers that are correctly predicted to have survived.
